 <h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
 <hr>
 <p > The name combines the name of the city founder, <b>Major James Abbott</b>, and the Persian ending <b>ābād</b> 
 ,<br> meaning
 "settlement, town of". Abbottabad is one of two cities named after British army officiers in Pakistan, <br>the other
 being <b>Jacobabad</b>.</p>
 <h1>HISTORY</h1>
 <hr>
 <p> Following the Second <b>Anglo-Sikh War</b>, the <b>British</b> annexed the entire <b>Punjab region</b> up to <b>Peshawar</b>. Abbottabad
 was founded and named after <b>Major James Abbott</b> in January 1853, <br>a British military officer in the <b>Bengal Army</b>
 of the <b>British Raj</b>. Following its foundation Abbottabad replaced <b>Haripur</b> as <b>Hazara's</b> capital <br>and headquarters of
<b>Hazara District</b>  after the annexation of <b>Punjab</b>.</p>
<a href="" class="img"> <img src="images/view city.jpg" ></a>
<p> Abbott had left Haripur prior to founding Abbottabad and despite being ordered by Sir Frederick Currie to return
 to Haripur, Abbott: <br> <br> <b>"In Huzara I was a state Prisoner to the Sikh troops and garrison.... <br>To change my
 residence was imperative if I was to remain master of Huzara".</b> <br>
  Major Abbott remained the first Deputy Commissioner of Hazara district from 1845 until April 1853, he is noted
 for having written <br>a poem titled <b>"Abbottabad" </b>, before his return to Britain, in which he wrote of his fondness for
 the town and his sadness at having to leave it. <br>In 1849, Major Abbott, a Deputy Commissioner appointed by the
British East Company, shifted Hazara Gojaran's <br>headquarter
 from Haripur Gojaran to the newly established Abbottabad.
 On 9 November 1901 <b>Lord Curzon</b>, the British Governor
General <br>of India, established the <b>North-West Frontier Province</b>
 from the north-western districts of <b>The Punjab</b>, this meant
 that Abbottabad was <br>now a part of the newly formed
 province. That year the population of the town and
 cantonment was 7,764 with an average income of <br>Rs. 14,900,
 this increased to Rs. 22,300 in 1903, chiefly derived from
<b> octroi</b>. During this time chief public institutions were built
 such as the Albert Victor <br>Unaided Anglo-Vernacular High
 School, the Municipal Anglo-Vernacular High School and the
 government dispensary. In 1911, the population <br>had risen to
 11,506 and the town contained four battalions of Gurkhas.[10]
 In the early 20th century, Abbottabad became an important
 military <br><b>cantonment</b> and <b>sanatorium</b>, serving as the
 headquarters of a brigade in the <b>Second Division of the
 Northern Army Corps. </b>The garrison consisted <br>of four
 battalions of native infantry, of the Frontier Force (including
 the 5th <b>Gurkha Rifles</b>) <br>and two native mountain batteries.

<p> On the 24th of August 1945 upon hearing of the death of
<b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b>  future Indian Prime Minister <br>Nehru
 addressed a public meeting in the city Abbottabad where he
 reportedly paid tearful tribute to Bose, <br>Nehru had arrived via
 the resort town of <b>Nathia Gali</b> earlier that day.
 Following the <b>Announcement of Partition of <br>the British Raj</b>
 into the <b>Dominion of Pakistan</b> and the <b>Dominion of India, a
 referendum was held in <br>the NWFP</b> to decide whether to join
 India or Pakistan - the result was in favour of joining <br>
 In 1947, <b>Pakistan Army's</b> initial officer training academy, the <b>Pakistan Military Academy</b>, referred to <br>by its acronym PMA
 was established in Abbottabad - Abbottabad continues to
 house this establishment today. <br>In June 1948, the <b>British Red
 Cross</b> opened a hospital in Abbottabad to deal with
 thousands of injured people <br>being brought in from
 Kashmir.
 In <b>1955</b>, Abbottabad and the rest of the NWFP became a part
 of <b>West Pakistan</b>, <br>but the NWFP province was once again
 established in <b>1970</b>, and <b>Hazara District </b>and the two tribal
 agencies <br>were merged to form the new <b>Hazara Division</b> with
 its capital at Abbottabad.</p>
