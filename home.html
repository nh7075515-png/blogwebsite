        <h1>What is BLOG?</h1>
        <p> 
       A 
blog
 (a truncation of "
 weblog
 ") is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal
 diary-style text entries also known as posts. Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological
 order so that <br>the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. In the 2000s, blogs were
 often<br> the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a <br>single
 subject or topic. In the 2010s, multi-author blogs (MABs) emerged, featuring the <br>writing of multiple
 authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, <br>other media outlets,
 universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for <br>an increasing
 quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs
 and single-author blogs into the news media. 
Blog
 can also be used as a verb, meaning 
to maintain
 or add content to a blog

          <h1>ABBOTTABAD</h1> <hr><p> <b>Abbottabad</b> is a city in the <b>Hazara</b> Division of  <b>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</b>
             province, Pakistan. It is the <b>40th largest city</b>
 in the country and <b>6th largest</b> in the province by population, <br> and serves as the headquarter of its namesake
<b>tehsil</b> and <b>district</b>. It is about 120 km (75 mi) north of <b>Islamabad-Rawalpindi</b>  and 150 km (95 mi) east of <b>Peshawar</b> 
 ,<br> at an elevation of 1,256 m (4,121 ft). <b>Kashmir</b> lies a short distance to the east.</p>
 <h1>ETYMOLOGY</h1>
 <hr>
 <p > The name combines the name of the city founder, <b>Major James Abbott</b>, and the Persian ending <b>ābād</b> 
 ,<br> meaning
 "settlement, town of". Abbottabad is one of two cities named after British army officiers in Pakistan, <br>the other
 being <b>Jacobabad</b>.</p>
 <h1>HISTORY</h1>
 <hr>
 <p> Following the Second <b>Anglo-Sikh War</b>, the <b>British</b> annexed the entire <b>Punjab region</b> up to <b>Peshawar</b>. Abbottabad
 was founded and named after <b>Major James Abbott</b> in January 1853, <br>a British military officer in the <b>Bengal Army</b>
 of the <b>British Raj</b>. Following its foundation Abbottabad replaced <b>Haripur</b> as <b>Hazara's</b> capital <br>and headquarters of
<b>Hazara District</b>  after the annexation of <b>Punjab</b>.</p>
<a href="" class="img"> <img src="images/view city.jpg" width="700px" height="400px"></a>
<p> Abbott had left Haripur prior to founding Abbottabad and despite being ordered by Sir Frederick Currie to return
 to Haripur, Abbott: <br> <br> <b>"In Huzara I was a state Prisoner to the Sikh troops and garrison.... <br>To change my
 residence was imperative if I was to remain master of Huzara".</b> <br>
  Major Abbott remained the first Deputy Commissioner of Hazara district from 1845 until April 1853, he is noted
 for having written <br>a poem titled <b>"Abbottabad" </b>, before his return to Britain, in which he wrote of his fondness for
 the town and his sadness at having to leave it. <br>In 1849, Major Abbott, a Deputy Commissioner appointed by the
British East Company, shifted Hazara Gojaran's <br>headquarter
 from Haripur Gojaran to the newly established Abbottabad.
 On 9 November 1901 <b>Lord Curzon</b>, the British Governor
General <br>of India, established the <b>North-West Frontier Province</b>
 from the north-western districts of <b>The Punjab</b>, this meant
 that Abbottabad was <br>now a part of the newly formed
 province. That year the population of the town and
 cantonment was 7,764 with an average income of <br>Rs. 14,900,
 this increased to Rs. 22,300 in 1903, chiefly derived from
<b> octroi</b>. During this time chief public institutions were built
 such as the Albert Victor <br>Unaided Anglo-Vernacular High
 School, the Municipal Anglo-Vernacular High School and the
 government dispensary. In 1911, the population <br>had risen to
 11,506 and the town contained four battalions of Gurkhas.[10]
 In the early 20th century, Abbottabad became an important
 military <br><b>cantonment</b> and <b>sanatorium</b>, serving as the
 headquarters of a brigade in the <b>Second Division of the
 Northern Army Corps. </b>The garrison consisted <br>of four
 battalions of native infantry, of the Frontier Force (including
 the 5th <b>Gurkha Rifles</b>) <br>and two native mountain batteries.
