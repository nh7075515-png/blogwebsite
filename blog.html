        <p> A  <b>blog</b>

 (a truncation of "
 weblog
 ")is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal <br>
 diary-style text entries also known as posts.  <br>Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological
 order so that the most recent post appears  <br>first, at the top of the web page. In the <b>2000s,</b> blogs were
 often the work of a single individual,  <br>occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single
 subject or topic. In the  <b>2010s,</b> <br> multi-author blogs (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple
 authors and sometimes  <br>professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets,
 universities, think tanks, <br> advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing
 quantity of blog traffic.  <br>The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs
 and single-author blogs  <br>into the news media. <br>
 <b>Blog <br>
 can also be used as a verb, <br>meaning 
to maintain <br>
 or <br> add content to a blog
 .</b>
 <br>

 The emergence and growth of blogs in the late  <b>1990s </b>coincided with the advent of web publishing <br>
 tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who  <br>did not have much
 experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, knowledge of <br> such technologies as
 HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content  <br>on the Web, and early Web
 users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of  <br>the <b>2010s,</b> the majority are
 interactive <b>Web 2.0</b> websites, allowing visitors to leave online <br>comments, and it is this interactivity
 that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that  <br>sense, blogging can be seen as a form
 of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only  <br>produce content to post on their blogs but
 also often build social relations with their readers  <br>and other bloggers. Blog owners or authors
 often moderate and filter online comments to remove  <br>hate speech or other offensive content. There
 are also high-readership blogs  <br>which do not allow comments.

<p> Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, <br>
 and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or  <br>online
 brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text,  <br>digital images,
 and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs  <br>are primarily
 textual, although some focus on art  <br>(
 art blogs
 ), <br> photographs (
 photoblogs
 ),  <br>videos (
 video blogs <br>
 or <br>
 vlogs
 ),  <br>music (
 MP3 blogs
 ),  <br>and audio (
 podcasts
 ).  <br>In education, blogs can be used as instructional
 resources;  <br>these are referred to as 
edublogs <br>
 . Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring
 very short posts. <br>
 Blog
 and 
blogging
 are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media,  <br>especially
 when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on a <br>regular basis, so one could
be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram. A  <b>2022</b>  <br>estimate suggested that there
 were over 600 million public blogs out of more than  <br> <b>1.9 billion</b> websites.</p>

 <h1>HISTORY</h1> <hr>
 <p> The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December <b>17, 1997</b>. The short form "blog" was
 coined by <br> Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word 
weblog <br>
 into the phrase 
we blog
 in the sidebar
 of his blog Peterme.com in  <br> <b>May 1999.</b>Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used
 "blog" as both a noun and  <br>verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog")
 and devised the  <br>term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the
 <br> popularization of the terms.</p>
 <h1> Origins</h1><hr>
 <p> Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet,
 commercial  <br>online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early
 CompuServe, e-mail lists,  <br>and bulletin board systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum
 software created running <br> conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between
 messages on a virtual "corkboard". <br>
 Tim Berners-Lee created <br> what is considered by Encyclopedia Britannica to be "the first 'blog'" in
 1992 to discuss the progress  <br>made on creating the World Wide Web and software used for it.
From June  <br> <b>14, 1993,</b> Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What's New" list of
 new websites, updated daily and archived  <br>monthly. The page was accessible by a special "What's
 New" button in the  <br>Mosaic web browser.
 In November <b>1993 </b>Ranjit Bhatnagar started  <br>writing about interesting sites, pages and discussion
 groups he found on the internet,  <br>as well as some personal information, on his website Moonmilk,
 arranging them chronologically  <br>in a special section called Ranjit's HTTP Playground. Other early
 pioneers of blogging,  <br>such as Justin Hall, credit him with being an inspiration.
 The earliest  <br>instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web site created
 in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured  <br>a blog in a section called "Online Diary". The entries were
 maintained by featured Beanie  <br>Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.
 The modern blog evolved from  <br>the online diary where people would keep a running account of the
 events in their personal lives.  <br>Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.
 Justin Hall, who began  <br>personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is
 generally recognized  <br>as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle. Dave Winer's
 Scripting News is  <br>also credited with being one of the older and longer running weblogs. The
 Australian Netguide magazine <br>maintained the Daily Net News on their web site from <b>1996.</b> Daily
 Net News ran links and  <br>daily reviews of new websites, mostly in Australia.
 Another early blog was  <br>Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared diary of a person's personal
 life combining text,  <br>digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and
 EyeTap device to a  <br>web site in <b>1994.</b>  This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video
 together with text  <br>was referred to as sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in
 legal matters. Some early bloggers,  <br>such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, referred to
 their online presence as a zine,  <br>before the term blog entered common usage.
 The first research paper about  <br>blogging was Torill Mortensen and Jill Walker Rettberg's paper
 "Blogging Thoughts", which  <br>analysed how blogs were being used to foster research communities
 and the exchange of ideas and scholarship,  <br>and how this new means of networking overturns
 traditional  <br>power structures.</p>
 <h1> Technology</h1><hr>
 <p> Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.  <br>In <b>1995,</b> the "Online
 Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and <br>  updated manually before any blogging programs
 were available. Posts were made to appear in <br>reverse chronological order by manually updating text
based HTML code using FTP software in real <br> time several times a day. To users, this offered the
 appearance of a live diary that  <br>contained multiple new entries per day. At the beginning of each new
 day, new diary entries were  <br>manually coded into a new HTML file, and at the start of each month,
 diary entries were archived  <br>into their own folder, which contained a separate HTML page for every
 day of the month. Then,  <br>menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were updated
 manually throughout the site.  <br>This text-based method of organizing thousands of files served as a
 springboard to define future  <br>blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed
 years later.
 The evolution of electronic  <br>and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web
 articles posted in reverse  <br>chronological order made the publishing process feasible for a much
 larger and less  <br>technically inclined population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online
 publishing that  <br>produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser
based software is  <br>now a typical aspect of "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog
 hosting services,  <br>on regular web hosting services, or run using blog software.</p>
 <h1>Rise in  <br>popularity</h1>
 <p> After a slow start,  <br>blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the
 years following, being <br>further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog
 tools:
 <li> Bruce Ableson launched Open Diary in October <b>1998,</b>  which soon grew to thousands of online
 diaries. <br>Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming  <br>the first blog community where
 readers could add comments to other  <br>writers' blog entries.</li>
 <li> Brad Fitzpatrick started LiveJournal in March  <b>1999</b>.</li>
 <li> Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July <b>1999</b> as an easier alternative to maintaining a <br> "news
 page" on a Web site, followed by DiaryLand  <br>in September  <b>1999,</b> focusing more on a <br> personal diary
 community.</li>
 <li>Blogger (blogspot.com) was launched in <b>1999.</b> </li>
</p>
<h1>Types</h1>
<hr>
<p> There are many different types of blogs, <br> differing not only in the type of content, <br>but also in the way
 that content is  <br>delivered or written.</p>
 <h1>1- Personal blogs</h1>
 <p> The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a
 corporation or organization. <br> While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers,
 other than the blogger's  <br>immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have
 become popular, to the  <br>point that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A few
 personal bloggers  <br>have gained significant recognition beyond their  <br>immediate circles.</p>
 <h1>2- Collaborative blogs or group blogs</h1>
 <p> A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author. <br>The majority
 of high-profile collaborative blogs are organised according  <br>to a single uniting theme, such as
 politics, technology or advocacy. In recent years,  <br>the blogosphere has seen the emergence and
 growing popularity of more collaborative efforts,  <br>often set up by already established bloggers
 wishing to pool time and resources, both to reduce <br> the pressure of maintaining a popular website
 and to attract  <br>a larger readership.
</p>
<h1>3-Corporate and organizational blogs</h1>
<p> A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business or not-for-profit organization <br>or
 government purposes. Blogs used internally and only  <br>available to employees via an Intranet are
 called corporate blogs. Companies use internal  <br>corporate blogs to enhance the communication,
 culture and employee engagement in a  <br>corporation. Internal corporate blogs can be used to
 communicate news about company policies <br> or procedures, build employee esprit de corps and
 improve morale. Companies and other  <br>organizations also use external, publicly accessible blogs
 for marketing, branding, or public  <br>relations purposes. Some organizations have a blog authored by
 their executive; in practice, <br>many of these executive blog posts are penned by a ghostwriter who
 makes posts in the style of  <br>the credited author. Similar blogs for clubs and societies are called
 club blogs, group blogs, or  <br>by similar names; typical use is to inform members and other
 interested parties of club  <br>and member activities.</p>
 <h1> 4-Aggregated blogs</h1>
 <p> Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on a specific topic, product or <br>service
 and provide a combined view for its readers. This allows  <br>readers to concentrate on reading
 instead of searching for quality on-topic content and  <br>managing subscriptions. Many such
 aggregations called planets from name of Planet  <br>(software) that perform such aggregation,
 hosting sites  <br>usually have 
planet.
 subdomain in domain name (like http://planet.gnome.org/ ). <br>
 <b>By genre</b><p>Some blogs focus on a particular subject,  <br>such as <b><br>political blogs,  <br>journalism blogs,  <br>health blogs,
 <br> travel blogs (also known as 
travelogs
 ),  <br>gardening blogs,  <br>house blogs,  <br>Book Blogs,  <br>fashion
 blogs, <br> beauty blogs,  <br>lifestyle blogs,  <br>party blogs,  <br>wedding blogs, <br>photography blogs, <br>project blogs, <br>
 psychology blogs,  <br>sociology blogs, <br>education blogs,  <br>niche blogs, <br> classical music blogs,  <br>quizzing
 blogs,  <br>legal blogs (often referred to as a blawgs),  <br>or dreamlogs.</b> <br>How-to/Tutorial blogs are
 becoming increasing popular.  <br>Two common types of genre blogs are  <br>art blogs  <br>and music
blogs.  <br>A blog featuring discussions,  especially about home and family is not uncommonly called
 a mom blog. While not a legitimate type  <br>of blog, one used for the sole purpose of spamming is
 known as a splog. <br>
 <b>By media type</b><br> A blog comprising videos is called a vlog, one comprising links is called a linklog, <br>a site containing
 a portfolio of sketches is called a sketchblog or <br>one comprising photos is called a photoblog.
 Blogs with shorter posts and mixed media <br>types are called tumblelogs. Blogs that are written on
 typewriters and then scanned are  <br>called typecast or typecast blogs. A rare type of blog hosted on
 the Gopher Protocol is known  <br>as a phlog. <br>
 <b>By device</b> <br>A blog can also be defined by which type of device is used to compose it. <br>A blog written by a
 mobile device like a mobile phone or PDA could be <br>called a moblog. One early blog was
 Wearable Wireless Webcam, an online shared <br>diary of a person's personal life combining text,
 video, and pictures transmitted live <br>from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site.
 This practice of semi-automated <br>blogging with live video together with text was referred to as
 sousveillance. Such <br>journals have been used as evidence in legal matters.</p>

 <h1>5- Reverse blog</h1>
 <p> A reverse blog is composed by its users rather than a single blogger. This system has the <br>
 characteristics of a blog and the writing of several authors. <br>These can be written by several
 contributing authors on a topic or opened up for anyone <br>to write. There is typically some limit to
 the number of entries to keep it from operating <br>like a web forum.</p>
 <h1> Political dangers</h1>
 <p>Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. In some
 countries, Internet police <br>or secret police may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors or
 commentators. Blogs <br>can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media because a
 person can <br>create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace by using anonymity technology such as
 Tor. As a result, totalitarian <br>and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and punish
 those who maintain them. <br> <br>  In Singapore, two ethnic Chinese individuals were imprisoned under the country's anti-sedition law
 for posting anti-Muslim remarks in their blogs. <br>Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer was charged with
 insulting the Egyptian president Hosni <br>Mubarak and an Islamic institution through his blog. It is the
 f
 irst time in the history of Egypt that a <br>blogger was prosecuted. After a brief trial session that took
 place in Alexandria, the blogger was <br>found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for
 insulting Islam and inciting <br>sedition and one year for insulting Mubarak. Egyptian blogger Abdel
 Monem Mahmoud was arrested in  <br><b>April 2007</b> for anti-government writings in his blog. Monem is a
 member of the then banned <br>Muslim Brotherhood. After the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the Egyptian
 blogger Maikel Nabil <br>Sanad was charged with insulting the military for an article he wrote on his
 personal blog <br>and sentenced to three years. <br> <br>  After expressing opinions in his personal blog about the state of the Sudanese armed forces, Jan
 Pronk, United Nations Special <br>Representative for Sudan, was given three days notice to leave Sudan.
 The Sudanese army had <br>demanded his deportation. In Myanmar, Nay Phone Latt, a blogger,
 was sentenced to 20 years in jail for <br>posting a cartoon critical of head of state Than Shwe.</p>
 <h1>Personal safety</h1>
 <p> One consequence of blogging is the possibility of online or in-person attacks or threats against the <br>
 blogger, sometimes without apparent reason. In some cases, bloggers have  <br>faced cyberbullying.
 Kathy Sierra, author of the blog "Creating Passionate Users", was  <br>the target of threats and
 misogynistic insults to the point that she <br>cancelled her keynote speech at a technology conference
 in San Diego, fearing for her safety. While a blogger's anonymity  <br>is often tenuous, Internet trolls
 who would attack a blogger with threats or  <br>insults can be emboldened by the anonymity of the
 online environment, where some users are <br> known only by a pseudonymous "username" (e.g.,
 "Hacker1984"). Sierra and supporters  <br>initiated an online discussion aimed at countering abusive
 online behaviour and developed a  <br>Blogger's Code of Conduct, which set out a rules for behaviour
 in the <br> online space.</p>
